## 🌿 Project Overview

**ReWear** is a sustainable fashion assistant built as part of the Odoo Hackathon 2025. It helps users make **smarter, eco-conscious clothing swap decisions** with the help of intelligent scoring and points distribution logic.

Built using **TypeScript** and modern full-stack tooling, ReWear makes circular fashion intuitive and rewarding.

## 🚀 Core Features

- 🔢 **Smart Swap Point Scoring**  
  Each clothing item is scored based on:
  - Age of the product  
  - Brand quality  
  - Agent verification  
  - Bill authenticity  
  - Overall condition  

- 🎁 **Bonus Points System**  
  - Users earn a **2% bonus** of their total points during listing  
  - Additional bonus points on successful swaps  

- ⚖️ **Dynamic Swap Logic**  
  - **Equal-value swap** → Both users receive full point value  
  - **Unequal-value swap** → Lower-value item gets **proportional compensation** in points  

- 🔄 **Swap History & Reports**  
  - Track completed swaps, points earned/lost, and user performance

- 🔔 **Real-time Notifications**  
  - Get notified when:
    - Your item is requested  
    - Your request is accepted  
    - A new listing matches your interest
