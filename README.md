ReWear – Odoo Hackathon 2025 🌱

By: Shivam (Team TechTuskers)

Repository for the Odoo Hackathon 2025 entry “ReWear” by TechTuskers (Shivam, Uma, and Rounakk) – a TypeScript-based solution. 

📌 Project Overview
ReWear is a sustainable fashion assistant built on Odoo, helping users make smarter swap decisions. It:

Calculates a product's age, brand quality, agent verification, bill authenticity, and overall condition to compute a swap point score

Awards a 2% bonus of total points

Distributes points to users during listing initiation and upon successful swap completion

Handles two swap scenarios:

Equal-value swap: both participants get their full points

Unequal-value swap: compensates the difference proportionally from lower-value listings

Add swap history, notifications, reporting
